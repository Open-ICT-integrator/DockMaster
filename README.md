# Development
To start developing on this project, you will need to work in the running container. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. Also an IDE with some way to code in the container, for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
When you have the prerequisites, click on the green button on the bottom left corner of Visual Studio Code and select "Reopen in Container". This will start the container and open the project in the container. You can now start developing.
Run the project with and navigate to [localhost:8080/swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger) to see the result.
